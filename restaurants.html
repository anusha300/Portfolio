<h1 style="font-family:fantasy;">Five of My Favorite Restaurants in Fremont </h1>   

<h2 style="font-family: fantasy;"> CHIPOTLE :) </h2>
<p>Chipotle is one of my all time favorite (fast food) restaurants, and I always relish their burrito bowls. A healthy and delicious meal, it consists of proteins and neutrients. I can always go there knowing that I won't feel guilty about anything The food tastes great and is made quickly, while it is still an affordable price. Also, their chips and guac make a great cherry on top the the meal </p>

<h2 style="font-family:fantasy;"> SALA THAI :) </h2>
<p> Sala thai is another one of my favorite restaurants to go to. I love their chicken kabab as an appetizer (the sause that comes with it tastes amazing!) and their green curry with rice as a meal.</p>

<p>They give this mini dessert which I find so cute to look at and and so yummy to eat. It is basically whipped cream on top of an orange; it looks simple but it tastes really good</p>

<h2 style ="font-family:fantasy;">TANDOORI PIZZA :) </h2>
<p> If I had to say the first pizza place that came into my mind, I would blurt out tandoori Pizza. Their pizzas include fresh topings and have a touch of indian spices that I always enjoy; I especially love their paneer tikka and chicken tikka tandoori pizza. They also include a fun arcade place to play games and chill.  </p>

<h2 style="font-family:fantasy;">CAMPO DE BOCCI :) </h2>
<p>Campo di Bocce is one of the fancier restaurants, but the ambience and decoration in this Italian restaurant is gorgeous. They have full sized-courts to play a traditional Italian called bocce ball, and the resstaurant includes a rock climbing facility (but you have to pay sepatrately for this). Their appetizer, which is sourdough bread with different sauses, is delicious. I also enjoy their pastas and pizzas.</p>
